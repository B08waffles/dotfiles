#+title: dotfiles

These files and folders contain my custom configuration for my favorite
applications, you can use these by copy pasting parts from them or downloading
them directly. Either way, if you do use these just make sure you have all the
dependencies necessary in order to run your system with these configs.

I may add an install script at some point but until then an installation would
need to be done by hand.

** Note
If you use the .vimrc provided here, I use the "Pathogen" plugin
manager. Inside "~/.vim/bundle" are the following:
+ coc.nvim
+ css-color
+ dracula
+ lightline.vim
+ nerdtree
+ rainbow_parentheses
+ vim-devicons
+ vim-fugitive
+ vim-latex-live-preview
+ vim-polygot
+ vim-startify
+ vim-which-key

  I configured Vim to be a replacement for my previous IDE of choice,
  VS Code, or more specifically "Code OSS", therefore I carried over
  many conveniences from "Code" over to Vim, however, I then found
  Doom Emacs and haven't looked back. Vim is still useful though as it
  is a highly extensible and lightweight command line text editor.
