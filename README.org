#+title: dotfiles

These files and folders contain my custom configuration for my favorite
applications, you can use these by copy pasting parts from them or downloading
them directly. Either way, if you do use these just make sure you have all the
dependencies necessary in order to run your system with these configs.

I may add an install script at some point but intil then an installation would
need to be done by hand.
